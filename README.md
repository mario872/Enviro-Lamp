# Enviro Lamp
This is a project ofr school, but because I *enhanced* it, I though I'd open source the code for it so that someone else can maybe build on it, or at the very least so I don't lose the code.

This was run only on the Waveshare RP2040-Zero running Adafruit Circuitpython.

More documentation on the code is available in the /src directory.

The lamp design can be found in / under design.pdf
